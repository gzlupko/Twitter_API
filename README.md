# Closing the Loop

Many scholars believe that learning analytics will not demonstrate real utility until it can "Close the Loop", use data to automate decision making. A common example of this system are email generators that send emails to students in response to an activity (or lack of activity). Several universities have had some success with this strategy such as George Washington University. There are an infinite number of these lopp closing activities that could be implemented and there is a lot of work to be done understanding when they are most useful.  

## Goals for this unit

* Be able to create an RMarkdown document
* Be able to download from the Twitter data stream and understand APIs
* Be able to schelude an email from within R
* Understand the consequences of automatically intervening in student activity

## Tasks for this unit

In this unit you will be working towards building a system that autogenerates a report and emails it to yourself. Since we do onot have access to LMA data in this assignment you will be downloading data from Twitter. You will need to setup a Twitter developer account in order to do this and understand how an API works. As background to this task please read over the follwing materials and watch the methodological videos. If you find any other useful materials please add them under Additional Materials at the end of the this page and pull request the change back to this repo.
